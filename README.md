# MagicDeckStats

An application for analyzing _Magic: The Gathering_ deck statistics and gameplay data, importing data from [BGStats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/). This is a Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) application built with .NET 8.

I mainly use it to track performance of Battle Decks and see how balanced they are against each other.
